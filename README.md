# Flopcoin-DuxOS Integration

## Goal
The Flopcoin-DuxOS Integration aims to seamlessly embed Flopcoin, a decentralized, proof-of-work cryptocurrency, as the native payment system within Dux OS. This integration enables secure, automated transactions for computational tasks and API/app usage in the DuxNet and Dux API Store, fostering a decentralized economy where nodes and developers are rewarded for their contributions with Flopcoin.

## Key Features
- **Flopcoin as Native Currency**: Powers payments for API/app usage and computational tasks within Dux OS.
- **Escrow-Based Payments**: The Escrow Daemon (`dux-escrowd`) holds Flopcoin during transactions, releasing 95% to providers and 5% to a community fund upon task completion.
- **Community Fund & Airdrops**: Accumulates 5% of each transaction in a shared wallet, airdropping 100 Flopcoin equally to verified, active Dux OS nodes when the fund reaches this threshold.
- **Secure Wallet Management**: The Flopcoin Wallet Daemon (`dux-flopd`) handles key generation, transactions, and wallet security with encryption.
- **Transparency & Governance**: Logs all transactions and allows configurable parameters (e.g., tax %, airdrop rules) via a governance layer.

## Purpose
This integration aims to create a self-sustaining, incentivized ecosystem within Dux OS, where Flopcoin facilitates payments for useful computational work and rewards active nodes through airdrops. It aligns the economic incentives of Flopcoin’s memecoin community with Dux OS’s vision of decentralized, collaborative computing.

## Getting Started
- Install Dux OS with the Flopcoin Wallet Daemon (`dux-flopd`) enabled by default.
- Use the Dux OS Wallet GUI to view balances, transaction history, escrow activity, and community fund status.
- Participate in DuxNet or the Dux API Store to earn or spend Flopcoin.
- Refer to the [Flopcoin Documentation](http://flopcoin.net/) and [Dux OS Guides](link-to-guides) for setup and usage.
